Installation hint:


1. Source the Ocean-SL-rc-file with the absolute path to the base directory of the installation
   for example:
$  . ./OceanDev/etc/ocean.rc $HOME/extractdir/OceanDev/
   
   Consider to put a valid command line into the terminal profile
   Hints: This command will setup two environment variables. The PATH and the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
   ...OceanDev/bin and ...OceanDev/lib respectively, so that the following command in step 2.
   should work.
   !!! The trailing slash in the absolute path name is needed for the internal resolution of 
   resource locations !!!

$  OceanGUI
